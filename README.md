# Reversi

Something from when I was still a noob at coding 🙃

## About
Reversi is a classic board game for two players just like chess, checkers and go.

### Rules

Each player has 2 tokens placed in the locations specified. The token’s location is reffered to by two digits in a row, separated by a comma – firstly the column and then the row. For example, “1,1” would refer to the top left cell.

Players will be randomly assigned a colour, red or blue. The red player will always move first, and then players will take turns with their moves until one player concedes the game by pressing ctrl-d or the enter key on a new line.

A valid move is a move where a player captures some opponent pieces. Please see the reversi rules for further details: http://www.yourturnmyturn.com/rules/reversi.php

An example of the board structure can be found below.
